            the bumblebee bat, calls Thailand home. You can also find the largest fish, the whale shark, in Thai waters.

            - Thailand loves its King, and shows great respect for the monarchy. The well-known Hollywood movie “The King and I” 
            was never shown in Thai theaters because it was considered to be derogatory to the King. How serious are they about 
            their King? Thailand has the lese majeste rule, meaning that if you commit disrespectful acts toward the King, you could be
            imprisoned for treason.

            - Showing respect for another person’s head is imperative in Thailand. The head is considered to be the most important part 
            of the body, and so Thai culture forbids touching anyone on the head (even a child). Should you meet someone who is older or 
            more important than you, it is best to lower your head in deference to show proper respect.
